# Chirpin

 ## Problem we are Solving
 Since kids these days find studies boring, to make it interesting we present we present the regular studies in the form of quizzes using AR's ground detection feature. 
Dyslexia is another tackling problem these days, chirpin' presents an easy to go speech to text and vice versa feature. 
Chirpin' last module is a complete soft skill training module that will evaluate body posture in real time and provide a VR environment for practice of public speaking using VR to make it interactive. 


## Novelty Of our Idea
Students these days find it boring to go through their books, kids with dyslexia find it difficult to identify letters and adults because of their introvert personality can't carry out conversation. The idea is in itself novel as it solves multiple real time problems. The mixed reality plays a significant role in coping up with solutions of the above problem. It can be a good example in business world as chirpin' is scalable. 
Since it has multiple use cases in ed-tech space, it can be deployed instantly. 

## Tech Stack
We have used Unity, C#, Open CV, Machine learning, python, etc
